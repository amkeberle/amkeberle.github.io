    <h2>Claim</h2>
    <p>The mechanism inside the mystery black box could be a self-starting siphon mechanism.</p>

    <h2>Evidence</h2>
    <p>The mystery black box is an unknown mechanism enclosed in a black box that transports water from an input on the top of the box to an output on the bottom front of the box. We initially observed varying output amongst trials, where in some trials more water was outputted than inputted, in other trials roughly the same amount was outputted, and in some trials the input and output were roughly the same. For example, in Trial 5, 500 mL were inputted and 1915 mL were outputted, in Trial 1, 500 mL were inputted and 0 mL were outputted, and in Trial 6, 500 mL were inputted and 510 mL were outputted. Our approach to figuring out the unknown mechanism was to build a model based off of the inputs and outputs we were seeing. Our team also tried listening to the box during a trial, with the goal of deciphering the mechanism inside. Our modelâ€™s key structure was a self-starting siphon, which was accompanied by a funnel and structural tubing. The siphon structure utilized the ideals of the Pythagoras Cup, where when the water rose above the tubed chamber, gravity caused the water to drain from the cup through the output tube. We tested our model by inputting various amounts of water- similar to what was tested in the mystery black box, so that we could compare the results- and record the outputs. In Trial 1 of our model, we inputted 500 mL and had an output of 0 mL. In Trial 5, we inputted 500 mL and had an output of 500 mL. Finally, in Trial 9 we inputted 50 mL and outputted 135 mL.</p>
    <h2>Reasoning Part 1</h2>
    <p>Models, or prototypes, are functional representations of a structure that you plan to build. They can be useful in testing possible solutions to a design challenge, as they can provide insight into whether or not your hypothesis is correct or not. A general strength of a model is that they provide a visual representation of your ideas, and general limitations are that they might not be exactly to size, or they might be simpler than the actual mechanism. This might provide alternative outcomes.</p>
    <h2>Reasoning Part 2</h2>
    <p>While the data from our model did not entirely match that of the mystery black box, it was clear that the data was similar in some fashion, and therefore, it can be deduced that the mechanism inside the mystery black box bears some resemblance to our model. For example, the results from Trial 1 of our model and the mystery black box both indicated an output of 0 mL when 500 mL was inputted. However, in Trial 5 of our model, when 500 mL was inputted, 500 mL were outputted, whereas in Trial 5 of the mystery black box 500 mL were inputted and 1915 mL were outputted. For both models, a consistent 500 mL was inputted for each prior trial; so, this evidence illustrates a difference in function between the mystery black box and our model. Therefore, because of the conflicting evidence, some in support and some refutting, we cannot whole-heartedly conclude that the mechanism inside the mystery black box is a self-starting siphon, however we can still consider it to be a possibility.</p>
    <h2>Reasoning Part 3</h2>
    <p>The data would have been different if an alternative claim was correct; for example, if our mechanism was 100% what was inside the mystery black box, the data from each trial would line up, or be proportional to, that of the trials of our model, with the assumption that the input was the same. On this wavelength, our self-starting siphon mechanism data lines up with that of the mystery black box on some occasions, but not others. On the other hand, if our mechanism was definitely not what was inside the mystery black box, the data from our model would have no correlation to that of the mystery black box. On this wavelength, our data has some similarities to the mystery black box data, so we cannot assume that the mechanism inside the black box does not include a self-starting siphon. We see varying similarities and differences in the data, as highlighted in the Evidence section; therefore, the mechanism inside the mystery black box could be a self-starting siphon mechanism.</p>
